``zigscan`` is an architecture-agnostic vectorized pattern scanner that supports IDA-style patterns as well as arbitrary mask and match patterns, allowing one to match individual bits within bytes.
It works with buffers of arbitrary length and alignment.

To use, direct ``build.zig.zon`` to download a commit archive and have your build script import a module called ``zigscan``. Then:

```zig
const std = @import("std");
const zigscan = @import("zigscan");

pub fn main() !void {
    var bytes: [16]u8 = undefined;
    @memset(bytes[0..], 0xEE);
    bytes[14] = std.crypto.random.int(u8);
    bytes[15] = 0xFF;

    std.debug.print("0x{X}\n", .{zigscan.scanIdaUnaligned(bytes[0..], "EE ?? FF").?});
}
```

```cmd
C:\test> .\test.exe
0xD
```

To get an idea of performance, you can run synthetic benchmarks using ``zig build run -Doptimize=ReleaseFast``.
The following is sample output on a Core i9-10900K, benchmarked against a naive pattern scanner in ``src/sigscan.zig``:
